The team aims to meet on Wednesday's at 5 each week in order to review the progress that is made. For sprint review, we plan to meet Wednesdays at Noon or Wednesdays at 5PM depending on instructor availability.

This way there is communication each week of the sprint and a review of the team's work near the end of the sprint.
