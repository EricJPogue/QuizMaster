The team aims to meet on Wednesday's at 5PM each week in order to review the progress that is made. For sprint review, we plan to meet Wednesdays at Noon or Wednesdays at 5PM depending on instructor availability.

This way there is communication between teammembers at least once a week and a review of the team's work near the end of the sprint.
